    <h2>Ingredients : </h2>
    <h3>For the brine: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>33 grams salt (1/4 cup Diamond Crystal kosher salt, or 2 tablespoons Morton kosher salt, or 1 1/2 tablespoons fine sea salt)</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>For the chicken:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 to 2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoons paprika</li>
        </ul>


    <h2>Steps : </h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Brine the chicken breast</strong>:
                In a large bowl, whisk the salt in the water to dissolve. Add the chicken breasts to the brine. Put in the refrigerator and chill for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Prepare your grill</strong>:
                Arrange your grill so that one side is for high direct heat, and the other side is cooler. Alternatively, you can use a grill pan, set over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li><strong>Coat the chicken with oil and paprika</strong>:
                Remove chicken breasts from brine and pat dry. Coat with olive oil, and sprinkle evenly with paprika.</li>
            <li><strong>Grill the chicken breasts</strong>:
                Brush some olive oil on the grill grates. Place chicken breasts on the hot side of the grill (or on the grill pan). Let the chicken grill, undisturbed, until the pieces start getting some grill marks (you can lift up one to check).
                
                When the chicken pieces have browned on one side, turn them over, and move them to the cooler side of the grill (low heat, not no heat). Cover, and let them finish cooking.
                
                Remove chicken from grill when the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 155Â°F.</li>
            <li><strong>Rest the chicken breasts, then serve</strong>:
                Cover the breasts with foil. The chicken will continue to cook in its residual heat while it rests. Let it rest 5 to 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
